### Notes

The R code can be executed with data placed into the `Data` folder of the RProject.
For project folders where data is absent from this repo, it is available seprately at zenodo ([10.5281/zenodo.11396014](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.11396014)), due to GitHub space constraints.

Fiji scripts for image analysis are included in the `Script` folder of the respective project.
